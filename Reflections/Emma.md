# Reflection

### Dificulties
Managing time was tough and the project felt like it ate alot of time everything in it took such a long time to do and soemtimes we would work on the same thigs.
Filling out all of the tasks in the proect took along time and it was fairly confusing. 
### Suprises
Atuff just didnt work I made a map and then the players fell over it into the void. Merge conflicts took forever to deal-with and sometimess when we did one the 
things we just did would vanish and then everything broke. I was suprised at how much caden was siting on the floor at the end of the project. 
### Lessions Learned
I learned that we should start earlyer, read the rubric before making things and coding is hard and confusing.
