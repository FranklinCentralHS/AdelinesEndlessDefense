# Reflection

### Dificulties
Managing time was tough and the project felt like it ate alot of time everything in it took such a long time to do and soemtimes we would work on the same thigs.
Filling out all of the tasks in the proect took along time and it was fairly confusing. I tried to make a pause button and it didnt work because pausing the game paused the pause button and that made it not un-pause. 
### Suprises
A tuff just didnt work I made a map and then the players fell over it into the void. Merge conflicts took forever to deal-with and sometimess when we did one the 
things we just did would vanish and then everything broke. I was suprised at how much caden was siting on the floor at the end of the project. 
I was supriesed that caden sat on the floor and was **productive**. I was also supries at how much caden did on the floor and how much needed done.
### Lessions Learned
I learned that we should start earlyer, read the rubric before making things and coding is hard and confusing.
Coding is a vary dificult task, making tilestes is hard. I learned how to make the levels.
