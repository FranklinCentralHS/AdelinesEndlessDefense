# Reflection
All metinons of social loafing or complaints about productivity are made with the knolage that
- Payton is excluded she worked alot and was amazing for this tean ***** 
- I missed days and during that time I know nothing about their productivity
  
### Dificulties
  I had some initial dificulties with seperating the players in a way that made them *Diferent*. I also had some problems understanding the rubric,
at times. We definintely struggled with being over ambititous. I personaly belive that we struggled the most with comunication we worked on items and it caused
us to sometimes work on near the same thing for example at one point me and Emma were working on levels at the same time and while we did fuse them together we waised alot of time on things like that. Social loafing was strong in this project I feel. I had personal dificulties with VS code.

### Suprises
  I was suprised how far apart the dificulty in the rubric was form one 10 point item to another. Project wise I was suprised with the amount of times, 
one small thing caused everything to blowup, a many times i would change a stat on an enemy and they would start vibrating and killing the palyer instantly.
I was also suprised at the amount I googled something and was halfway through it before finding an infintintely simpeler answer to the problem. Building on thet,
the amount of things that a learned how to use that did the same things was shocking. I was only slightly suprised by the rate at wich Payton got art done, she was extrimely quick with an item, if I asked for any bit of art It would relyably be done in a busness week. I don't know how the art prosess worked but I was happy at the speed that the art went. The problem is that it speed of coding a thing and making it visualy are not the same. I could make the thing that used the art in a day, this resulted in me meking things that had not yet had a visual so for a bit of time eveything was the amazon logo. 

### Lessions Learned

  I learned a lot about coding, a little about games, and I hope to say a bit about myself. I learned that the best thing to do is start, no matter how much planing you do plans change and you only have so much time. I learned that nothing should be usable in only one case, everything is better when you make it repeatable. I learned late into the project (too late to add sadly) that classes are the GOAT, they de-clutter your scripts, they make making things easyer and, they are usefull for logic (if __ is __)
I leaned how to use shaders and have started to understand the value of resources. I learled a bit about games, every level should have something new and something old. If the levels have nothing new there is nothing to hold your attention, if there is nothing old you may as well learn a new game every level. Games also dont work without the artists, a game with no visual does not work, It is a static game with nothing astetic to hold you in the world, additionaly its ahrd to understand thing when they arent visualy there. I also notised that fun is not easy, you can have interesting mechanics and brilient asthetics but an idea on paper sounds more fun than it sometimes is.
I learned that I as a person will be at liest as productive as the second most productive person out of shere pride and *anxiaty*, but also that I get drained fast when I am the only person (coding wise) that is doing things. Also that while I may over do it with out of class time, when i'm not "into" the project its not as good of a turnout. 
I also changed my mind about VS code about a million times. Currently I think godots updates have made it realy only usefull for dealing with conflicts. 
If I could restart I would:
- Start with the levels and then make the players
- Use shaders and custom signals EVERYWHERE
- Add a paralax background to make the background less bland
- Cut the work into aproprite sized pieses and branch them all seprately so others could work on it easyer

##### Final Thoughts
While I still dont know the diference between a Run N Gun and a platformer, I learned alot and for that I am content with the results.
