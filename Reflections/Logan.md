# Reflection

### Dificulties
I had alot of bugs that took along time to deal with while making the player. 
I had less time than was needed for the project.
Figureing out what needs done was dificult and it took a lot of time.

### Suprises
Alot of things were more dificult than expected and some things just didnt work.
I was suprised at the amount of code that needed made. I lost alot of work to an accidental tab closure. 
I wasn't expecting how easy it would be to break things.

### Lessions leared
Coding takes along time. Some people try to hard.
