# Reflection

### Dificulties
I had alot of bugs that took along time to deal with while making the player. 
I had less time than was needed for the project.
Figureing out what needs done was dificult and it took a lot of time.
I also had extrime dificulty with a thing called "Social Loafing"
I had trubble navigating godot and geting it on the computer was tough. 
The files were never organised.

The most dificult thing was probably staying on task, people were loud and it made it hard to focus.

### Suprises
Alot of things were more dificult than expected and some things just didnt work.
The amount of code that needed made was a lot more than i expected. I lost alot of work to an accidental tab closure. 
I wasn't expecting how easy it would be to break things even if it was just a number change.
The dificulty of this project and felt a bit unprepared for the work.

### Lessions leared
Coding takes along time. Some people try to hard.
I learned how comftrable the floor cabenent is, 7/10 acceptable.
I learned that this kind of project or invironment is not one in wich I tend to thrive.
