# Reflection

### Difficulties
I had a lot of bugs that took a long time to deal with while making the player. 
I had less time than was needed for the project.
Figuring out what needs done was difficult and it took a lot of time.
I also had extreme difficulty with a thing called "Social Loafing"
I had trouble navigating godot and getting it on the computer was tough. 
The files were never organised.
There was a lot of code and that was unexpected. I forgot to save alot an it lost time. 

The most difficult thing was probably staying on task, people were loud and it made it hard to focus.

### Surprises
A Lot of things were more difficult than expected and some things just didn't work.
The amount of code that needed to be made was a lot more than I expected. I lost a lot of work to an accidental tab closure. 
I wasn't expecting how easy it would be to break things even if it was just a number change.
The difficulty of this project and felt a bit unprepared for the work.

### Lessons learned
Coding takes a long time. Some people try too hard.
I learned how comfortable the floor cabinet is, 7/10 acceptable.
I learned that this kind of project or environment is not one in which I tend to thrive.
