# Reflection

### Dificulties
Things I found difficult was drawing backgrounds/scenes, Im not very used to it. I usually do character work or illustrations focusing on the character.
I also found drawing Inferno, the fox companion, a little bit hard because Im also not used to drawing animals. But I've been getting better at animals and
enjoying it.

### Suprises
I was surprised with how fun drawing animals actually is, before I never really had an interest too. I was also surprised to enjoy making the backgrounds 
as well, even though I think I couldve done better. I was also surprised with how well Inferno turned out, as Ive never drawn a fox before, 
let alone make sprites for one.

### Lessions Learned
I should definitely learn to spend my time more wisely, the deadline came faster than I anticipated. I should also double check before saving an artwork, 
because sometimes there are tiny mistakes that go unoticed on accident. I will also try to be neater with the art next time, to look more professional
and whatnot because I think I couldve done better but Im also a perfectionist.
